## About The Project


There are many great websites available on GitHub and on other sites; however, we didn't find one that really suited our needs so we created this enhanced one. Actually we want to create a site, so amazing that it'll be the best& the last one you ever had seen  -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others more preciously saves time, this was our main moto..
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating any site or any gforms (JRs for you guys)..
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your lifeðŸ˜‰.. 

Of course, no sites will serve all your needs. So we'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking the repo and creating a small pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to this site..
